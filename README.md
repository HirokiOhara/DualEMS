This repository contains source code of software from our work "DualEMS: Two-Channel Arbitrary Waveform Electrical Muscle Stimulation Device to Design Interference Stimulation" (ACM AHs2022).


## Parameters
You can easilly set the following parameters:
- Pulse number
- Pulse type
- Pulse pole
- Pulse orientation
- Pulse frequancy
- Pulse width
- Stimulation time


## Tips
Also, you can get the force data and show graphic animation using Leptrino's sensor.
The graphic animation is already set up to represent Y-axis rotation in the sensor's coordinate system.
If you want chage the graphic animation, edit "rotateAnimation" file.
